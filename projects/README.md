# Portfolio Projects

> 15 portfolio-grade builds, each demonstrating a specific in-demand skill.
> Each project ships with `README.md`, `src/`, `tests/`, `evals/`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## The 3-project portfolio

You don't need all 15. Pick three that span the stack:

| RAG-heavy | [02-hybrid-rag-over-notion](./02-hybrid-rag-over-notion/) |
| Agent-heavy | [05-multi-agent-research-pipeline](./05-multi-agent-research-pipeline/) |
| Production-heavy | [08-cost-optimized-routing-proxy](./08-cost-optimized-routing-proxy/) |

## Status

All 15 are currently skeletons. Each contains:
- `README.md` with problem, architecture, stack, eval metrics.
- `pyproject.toml` with a minimal dependency spec (`>=` floors; tighten when you implement).
- `Makefile` with `install`, `run`, `test`, `eval` targets.
- `tests/test_smoke.py` — replace with real tests.
- `evals/golden.jsonl` + `evals/eval_runner.py` — replace placeholders with real cases.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` with deployment + postmortem template.
- `Dockerfile`.

To bring a project to "portfolio-ready": fill in `src/`, write real tests, populate the golden dataset, ship a demo.

## Difficulty legend

- 🟢 BEG — Approachable after Rungs 0–3.
- 🟡 INT — Approachable after Rungs 0–7.
- 🔴 ADV — Approachable after Rungs 0–8.
- ⚫ EXP — Approachable after Rungs 0–11 + production experience.
