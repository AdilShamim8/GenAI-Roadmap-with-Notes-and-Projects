#### Key Model Changes Since March 2026:
- 🆕 OpenAI released **GPT-5.5** on April 23, 2026 — described as "our smartest and most intuitive to use model yet," excelling at writing and debugging code, researching online, analyzing data, creating documents, and operating software. GPT-5.5 matches GPT-5.4 per-token latency while performing at a much higher level of intelligence and using significantly fewer tokens to complete the same tasks.
- 🆕 **GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.5 Pro** became available in the Responses and Chat Completions APIs on April 24, 2026. GPT-5.5 is priced at $5/1M input tokens and $30/1M output tokens; GPT-5.5 Pro at $30/1M input and $180/1M output.
- 🆕 GPT-5.5 Pro is the same underlying model as GPT-5.5 but uses parallel test-time compute for even higher accuracy.
- 🆕 Anthropic released **Claude Opus 4.7** on April 16, 2026 — a notable improvement on Opus 4.6 in advanced software engineering, with particular gains on the most difficult tasks. It features better coding, sharper vision (3.75MP resolution), a new xhigh effort level for finer reasoning control, task budgets for developer cost management, and 2x agentic throughput. Priced the same as Opus 4.6 at $5/$25 per million tokens.
- 🆕 **Claude Mythos Preview** was announced April 7, 2026 — Anthropic's most powerful model, capable of finding critical vulnerabilities in major operating systems and web browsers. The UK AI Security Institute confirmed it was the first model to solve a 32-step cyber range end-to-end. Anthropic chose NOT to release it publicly, instead deploying it through **Project Glasswing**, an invitation-only consortium for defensive cybersecurity workflows.
- 🆕 Anthropic is using the Opus 4.7 rollout to test real-world cybersecurity safeguards that automatically detect and block prohibited or high-risk uses, with the stated goal of eventually enabling a broad release of Mythos-class models.
- 🆕 On February 19, 2026, Google released Gemini 3.1 Pro. It is Google's latest reasoning-first model optimized for complex agentic workflows and coding, with adaptive thinking and a 1M token context window.
- 🆕 Gemini 3 Flash is now the default model in the Gemini app, offering next-generation intelligence at lightning speed with PhD-level reasoning comparable to larger models.
- 🆕 Meta released Llama 4 — Llama 4 Maverick is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts model built for textual and visual understanding and efficient deployment.
- 🔮 Anthropic confirmed a new in-development model called **"Claude Mythos"** (full release TBD) — currently the most capable model Anthropic has built, but not broadly released due to cybersecurity safety concerns. A new product tier called "Capybara" will be added above Opus when Claude Mythos launches publicly.

### Key GenAI Trends in 2026

1. **Agentic AI Revolution** – AI agents now autonomously manage workflows, interact with tools, use computers directly, and orchestrate multi-step processes
2. **Computer Use & Tool Search** – Models can now control browsers, desktops, and software UIs; API-level tool search reduces token overhead
3. **Multimodal by Default** – Models seamlessly process text, images, video, audio, and code; native image/video generation built in
4. **Smaller, Greener Models** – Quantization, MoE architectures, and pruning enable efficient edge deployment (GPT-5.4 mini/nano, Gemini Flash Lite)
5. **AI-Native Enterprises** – GenAI embedded in core business operations with autonomous coding agents (Claude Code, Codex)
6. **Ethics as Engineering** – Responsible AI practices built directly into development pipelines; cybersecurity implications of frontier models (Claude Mythos Preview) driving cautious, governance-first rollouts

LangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs — with under 10 lines of code you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more. LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly.

This repository demonstrates how to leverage LangChain for:

- **Building Complex Reasoning Chains** with LCEL
- **Creating Domain-Specific Chatbots** with custom memory
- **Implementing Production RAG Systems** with hybrid retrieval
- **Developing Autonomous Agents** with LangGraph
- **Connecting LLMs to External Tools and APIs** via MCP Adapters
- **Deploying Secure, Observable AI Systems** with LangSmith Fleet

### LangChain v1.2.16 Key Features (May 2026)

    HumanInTheLoopMiddleware
)

agent = create_agent(
    model="gpt-5.5",  # Updated: GPT-5.5 is the latest frontier model as of May 2026
    tools=[search_tool, calculator_tool],
    middleware=[
        PIIMiddleware(),
        SummarizationMiddleware(max_tokens=4000),

# Create a prompt template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful AI assistant."),
    ("user", "Write a short paragraph about {topic}.")

### LangGraph Agent (Updated May 2026 — LangGraph v1.1.10)

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def search_web(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for information."""
    # Implement web search
    return f"Search results for: {query}"

@tool
def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    """Evaluate a mathematical expression."""
    return str(eval(expression))

# Create agent with LangGraph
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-5.5")
agent = create_react_agent(llm, [search_web, calculate])

# Run agent with state management
result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [("user", "What is 25 * 4 and who invented calculus?")]
})
print(result["messages"][-1].content)
```

### Using create_agent with Middleware (LangChain v1.2.16)

```python
from langchain import create_agent
from langchain.middleware import (
    PIIMiddleware,
    SummarizationMiddleware,
    HumanInTheLoopMiddleware
)

# Production agent with middleware stack
agent = create_agent(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",  # Or "gpt-5.5", "gemini-3.1-pro"
    tools=[search_tool, calculator_tool, file_tool],
    middleware=[
        PIIMiddleware(),
        SummarizationMiddleware(max_tokens=4000),
        HumanInTheLoopMiddleware(require_approval=["sensitive_action"])
    ]
)

result = agent.invoke({"input": "Analyze this quarterly report"})
```
