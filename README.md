# GenAI Engineering Roadmap

<p align="center">
  <strong>The production-grade, evals-first, career-aware roadmap for GenAI engineers in 2026.</strong>
  <br/>
  <em>From "I can call the OpenAI API" to "I shipped a multi-agent system that runs in production with SLOs and an evals harness."</em>

## What this is

A **rigorously-sourced, file-per-topic, evals-first** roadmap for becoming a production GenAI engineer. Every factual claim is cited and dated in [`LAST_VERIFIED.md`](./LAST_VERIFIED.md). Every topic follows a [consistent template](./CONTRIBUTING.md#topic-file-template). Every project ships with code, tests, and an evals harness.

This is **not** a link dump. This is **not** a single 600-line README. This is **not** LangChain-only. This is the roadmap a principal AI engineer would recommend without caveats.

## What this is not

- Not a tutorial. Topics assume you can read Python and understand HTTP.
- Not exhaustive. We picked one lane — **production GenAI engineering** — and go deep.
- Not a model leaderboard. We cover architectures and patterns that survive model releases.

## Curated external resources

[`awesome/`](./awesome) — papers, books, courses, blogs, tools, communities. One-line reviews, not bare links.

## How to use this repo

1. **Read [`LAST_VERIFIED.md`](./LAST_VERIFIED.md)** to see when every factual claim was last checked.
2. **Pick a learning path** based on your background.
3. **Work the rungs in order.** Each rung links to the next.
4. **Build at least 3 projects** as you go. Code beats reading.
5. **Run the evals** that ship with each project. Internalize the evals-first mindset.

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: every factual claim must be sourced and dated, every file must follow the topic template, every project must ship with tests.

## License

MIT — see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).

## Acknowledgements

- [`alexeygrigorev/ai-engineering-field-guide`](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/ai-engineering-field-guide) for the field-guide playbook and the "data, not filler" philosophy.
- Every practitioner who has published a postmortem, evals harness, or agent architecture in public.
